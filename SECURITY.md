# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This repository does not currently maintain a formal support window. Security fixes are applied to the default branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for sensitive reports.

- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (private report) if enabled on the repository.
- Otherwise: contact the maintainers via a private channel you trust (e.g. email listed on the GitHub profile).

When reporting, include:

- Affected page/tool slug and browser/version
- Clear reproduction steps
- Impact assessment (what can an attacker do?)
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
