  "seoDescription": "Free online PDF encrypt decrypt tool that uses AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2(SHA-256) to locally encrypt entire PDF files in the browser and outputs savable encrypted JSON. Can also decrypt in the tool by entering a password to restore the original PDF. Due to pure static site limitations, this tool doesn't generate standard PDF open passwords but provides secure file-level encryption containers, suitable for private PDF backup and temporary transfer.",
