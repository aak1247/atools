  "seoDescription": "Free online seal forgery suspicion detector that supports uploading scanned documents/screenshots and performs pixel-level heuristic analysis on red seal areas, analyzing features such as connected components, boundary complexity, and color dispersion to provide suspicion scores and mask previews. Pure frontend local operation without image uploads, results are for reference only and should be combined with original documents and business processes for comprehensive judgment.",
